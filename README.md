# BouncingRockets
Multiplayer Quake Mod featuring rockets that bounce off walls
Inspired by an old mod vaguely remembered from late 90's with bouncing nails.  

This mod has rockets that bounce off of walls 5 times before exploding.  No other weapons allowed.  Explosions hurt from farther away and throw the player farther.

Thanks to Playtesters on the Quake Remastered Community Discord and JPiolho for his excellent repos and write-ups!
